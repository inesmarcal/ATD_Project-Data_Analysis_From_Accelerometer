# ATD_Project-Data_Analysis_From_Accelerometer
- [x] Finished

## Description
This project was developed for Data Analysis and Transformation subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering. <br>
Consists in develope a program that make a study about signals collected from smartphone accelerometers in order to classify/identify the activity performed, corresponding to 12 different movements:<br>
- Dynamics<br>
  1 - WALKING<br>
  2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS<br>
  3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS<br>
- Statics:<br>
  4 - SITTING<br>
  5 - STANDING<br>
  6 - LAYING<br>
- Transition:<br>
  7 - STAND_TO_SIT<br>
  8 - SIT_TO_STAND<br>
  9 - SIT_TO_LIE<br>
  10 - LIE_TO_SIT<br>
  11 - STAND_TO_LIE<br>
  12 - LIE_TO_STAND<br>
  
 This analysis was done in the time and frequency domains using mathematical transforms like DFT and STFT.
